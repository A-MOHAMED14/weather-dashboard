# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The Weather Dashboard utilizes the 5 Day Weather Forecast API from OpenWeather to retrieve and display weather data for cities worldwide. Users can search for current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city, with results displayed in a clear and visually appealing format. The application saves the search history in local storage, allowing users to quickly access previously searched cities through clickable buttons. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
